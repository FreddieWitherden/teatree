About Teatree

  Teatree is  a parallel N-body solver for  electrostatic systems.  It
  is written in C++ and is designed for simulating dense plasmas.

Compile Time Requirements

  In order to build teatree it is necessary to have first installed:

    • Boost C++ libraries version 1.47 or later [1];
    • Eigen version 3 or later [2];
    • CMake version 2.8 or later [3];

  both  of  which  are  readily  available  on  all  recent  GNU/Linux
  distributions.  Users of Mac OS  X can obtain these packages through
  MacPorts  [4].   Since  teatree   makes  use  of  advanced  template
  metaprogramming  techniques it  is  important to  build  it using  a
  recent C++  compiler.  As of  November 2011 the  following compilers
  are known to have successfully built teatree:

    • GCC 4.2; 4.5+ recommended for performance reasons;
    • Clang 2.9; sans OpenMP due to lack of compiler support.

  During  the configure  stage  the build  scripts will  automatically
  instruct the  compiler to  generate a binary  specifically optimised
  for the current CPU architecture.  A consequence of this is that the
  resulting  binaries may  not run  on  systems with  a different  CPU
  architecture.

Runtime Requirements

  Although  most  of  the  dependencies  are  header-only  some  Boost
  components  used   by  teatree   also  have  a   runtime  component.
  Specifically, the  `program_options' and `serialization' frameworks.
  The  unit test  binaries also  depend on  the `unit_test_framework'.
  Where binary portability is required it is recommended to link these
  elements in statically to teatree.

Building Teatree

  After extracting the teatree archive teatree can be built by issuing
  the following commands:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" ../
    $ make

  for  further information  on the  build process  please  consult the
  CMake documentation.   After building teatree  it is crucial  to run
  the associated unit tests:

    $ make test

  which verify that the  various components of teatree are functioning
  correctly.
